## Why Hackathons are bad for you

### Why Hackathons are bad for you

I hate Hackathons 💔. That's a bit ironic because as a developer I have participated in quite a few: a <kbd>[Game Jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam)</kbd> for beginners, <kbd>[CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/home)</kbd> (which I still love 💖 nevertheless), teaming up with a friend… but there was always something about the concept that didn't agree with me 🤔.

If you think about it, it has nothing to do with the way teams 👪 construct a modern software product in most companies. For example, in such a short time, you cannot implement a real Agile Methodology for your project 🧮.

I think Hackathons generally proclaim <kbd>[a big myth](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/team-geek/9781449329839/ch01.html)</kbd> in our global dev community: "a good programmer should just ignore their need to rest and just code all night, drinking enormous amounts of coffee ☕, in order to be able to finish a product worthy of the public attention 🤘🏼". I believe this is more intense in the game development industry 🏭, where indies and <kbd>[employees are usually "crunching"](https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/21575914/cyberpunk-2077-release-crunch-labor-delays-cd-projekt-red)</kbd> to meet impossible deadlines 📅.

### Why is crunch bad?


- It excludes people with healthy sleep routines 😪 from tech jobs

- It even excludes people with children 👶🏿 or old people 👵🏻 at their care who doesn't have so much free time ⏳

- A big portion of those excluded people are women and people older than 40 years, those who traditionally take care of other family members 👩‍👧‍👦. Those two groups are <kbd>[still minorities in our software industry](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#developer-profile-gender)</kbd>, while for example in the case of women 👩🏽, <kbd>[they actually are half of the global population](https://ourworldindata.org/gender-ratio#:~:text=And%20globally%20in%202017%20the,average%2C%20live%20longer%20than%20men.)</kbd>. I think we'll agree that men 👨🏻 <kbd>[should be included in this "caring responsibility"](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/are_women_more_compassionate_than_men)</kbd> but I don't think diversity will be accomplished meanwhile companies in Software Development 🏭 keep expecting people to work overtime every week and code all weekend in a Hackathon "to have fun" 🥱.

- Crunch damages the physical and mental health of the ones that experience it 😢. Mental health is one of the <kbd>[bigger health problems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3330161/)</kbd> on the rise in modern societies: and our industrial-age-old paradigms 🏭 about how to produce are just making it worse.


### But Hackathons…!

I understand the main counterpoint: Hackathons allow people to focus on a single task and motivates them to do things they normally would be too distracted to even try. But, is that really true? 🕵️‍♀️

I have known a lot of many developers in my career. And mostly all of them have told me a story about having an impossible-to-fix bug 🐛 or a feature too hard to design. But, after a good night's sleep or maybe just a peaceful walk, they had a breakthrough idea and fixed their issue in no time at all 💪.

They actually saved time having proper rest. They just needed to escape from the <kbd>[Cognitive Tunneling](https://dictionary.apa.org/cognitive-tunneling)</kbd> trap 🕳.

This kind of creativity 💭 that the mind can access when wandering off or by organizing thoughts and memories while sleeping is just not present in a Hackathon. There's too much rush and stress.

That pressure is cool when your goal is clear and your task monotonous, but a lot of Hackathon's themes are only decided inside the time limitation of 24-48 hours ⏰...

There's a good documentary 📺 named <kbd>[Take Your Pills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Your_Pills#:~:text=Take%20Your%20Pills%20is%20an,main%20focus%20of%20the%20documentary.)</kbd> about how our modern society is obsessed with being productive at all times.


### Is there a way to design better Hackathons?

Yes, indeed. There's a very good example in the "Unity" and "Games for Change" <kbd>[Cross-Cultural Impact Jam](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2021/04/27/global-collaboration-through-the-cross-cultural-impact-jam/)</kbd>. They decided to make the Jam one week long 📆, so students from different parts of the world could team up and participate while keeping up with their studies 👨🏿‍🎓.



### Closing time

So, yeah, I believe that's all I had to say about Hackathons 🤐. I cannot assure you that I myself won't be participating in any new Hackathon someday, but I'm sure in the future we will all out-grow this kind of practice as a global community, making Software Development a more inclusive and healthy environment 🌅.
