## 5 music albums to listen to while coding

### Some context

While I was working for <kbd>[Brújula](https://www.brujula.es/en/)</kbd>, we used to have a shared playlist 📚. Each week, one of the team members had to propose a music album 🎶 that they liked to listen to while working 👩🏾‍💻. At the end of the week, we voted which was our favorite song 👑, and that one went into the playlist.

There were a lot of different genres and tastes in music of course, but I'm gonna share with you some of the albums I proposed 🤗:


### 1. Spiritual State, by Nujabes

%[https://open.spotify.com/album/724juUMeWRW82bDoyH91Vd?si=7VBs3yOPRUK6YUbYQzRDQw]

If you are an anime fan, you might know Nujabes as the OST creator for the classic anime <kbd>[Samurai Champloo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_Champloo)</kbd>. Unfortunately, he died some years ago leaving us with just 4 albums.

This one is my favorite. Calm and good vibes are what this album is all about 🌴.

* Favorite song 👑: Prayer

### 2. Wildflower, by The Avalanches

%[https://open.spotify.com/album/6xaalWgqmC00dKgrFLlcmk?si=hxn1JaYATOOS7noAijneRg]

This band has an interesting creative process: they get old samples and mix them to create something new and usually much better (just as we coders mix and refine code to create a brand new feature).

The songs in this album chain with each other beautifully (if you listen to the album in order, of course), but each other is different; like functions in a program, each one has a clear objective but they all share a common bigger goal.

* Favorite song 👑: If I Was a Folkstar


### 3. Discovery, by Daft Punk

%[https://open.spotify.com/album/2noRn2Aes5aoNVsU6iWThc?si=T5mlyh4mQ2WGDKinHGvCMw]

Quite mainstream, but I think it's a must in a coding playlist. Personally, repetitive techno music just moves me to do methodical and focused activities: like coding! Such a shame they recently disbanded 💔.

Their creative process is similar to The Avalanches, as they mix old samples too 💿. 

Oh, by the way, check out <kbd>[Interstella 5555](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstella_5555:_The_5tory_of_the_5ecret_5tar_5ystem)</kbd> (not Interstellar, which is a great film too); an animation movie whose only soundtrack is this album. It narrates a powerful story about artists and the industry that markets them 🎁.

* Favorite song 👑: Digital Love

### 4. Drive Soundtrack - OST, by Kavinsky and many others

%[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1CnAtW2mIejhmERcoQN9Yx?si=6cbYTLeTSKeKfUJB5BFBYw]

I believe this one is not in album format, but it exists at least as a Spotify playlist 🎶.

I just love the <kbd>[Drive film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780504/)</kbd>, I believe its stronger points are the aesthetics and atmosphere it creates that sucks you in 🙂. The OST is a key element in that crafted experience, and it's quite immersive by itself.

* Favorite song 👑: Nightcall


### 5. The Cowboy Bebop EP, by Kendall x Mukashi

%[https://youtu.be/S4jGZTz4EwY]

It's not really an album, and it's quite short; but these people did what we programmers do best: stand in the shoulders of giants and build upon that 🏗.

<kbd>[Cowboy Bebop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop)</kbd> it's a space opera anime 🌌 in which most chapters are named after a music genre. That shows how important is the OST in this show.

This playlist was made combining those songs with dialogue clips from the series 📺.

* Favorite song 👑: Waltz on Venus.


### Closing time

Give them and try and let me know in the comments which ones you hated the most 😁.
