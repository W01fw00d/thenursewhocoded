## Getting Things Done

%[https://anchor.fm/gabriel-romaymachado/episodes/Getting-Things-Done-evqp2a]

### Some context

I used to have a sort of <kbd>[To-Do list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:To-do_list)</kbd> in my phone Notes app 📱, like many of us. But while I was working for <kbd>[Habitissimo](https://www.habitissimo.es/empleo)</kbd>, I had the chance to attend a workshop about <kbd>[Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)</kbd> by the incredible <kbd>[Jordi Contestí](https://twitter.com/jordi_contesti)</kbd>👨‍💻.

I abandoned my Notes app immediately after that.

The event focused on using <abbr title="Getting Things Done">GTD</abbr> for our personal and professional life 💪. We started writing a letter 📨 from our "1 year into the future" self, explaining "where" they were at the moment in relation to their goals and life expectations 🌟. This technique helped us to get our long-term goals in order 🗄.

Then we just divided those big goals into small tasks that we could complete independently during that year 📆.


### Why?

The ultimate goal of GTD is not really to be productive at all times, it's more about achieving ease of mind 😌. You see, when you have chores and other pending obligations in your mind, it is hard to relax or even focus on your current and more urgent task 🚨.

You write them down in a way you can come back and pick them up easily later when you are free 🤗. That way you prioritize what's more urgent, and you can forget about them and experience some <kbd>["Carpe diem"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem)</kbd>.

### My personal approach

I use a <kbd>[Trello](https://trello.com/)</kbd> To-Do Board managed similarly to a <kbd>[Kanban Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban)</kbd>:

- **Backlog** 🗃: I use this one for writing down new ideas. In case I write an idea for a game or app on a card, I usually move its data to GitHub issues/projects when I create the repository to develop it
- **Pending** ⏳: The tasks that are more important to me. I will pick them up next after I complete the tasks in [WIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_in_process)</kbd>. I order them inside the column, moving up the ones that are more urgent
- **WIP** ⚙: Tasks that are "Work in Process". I try to avoid working on more than 4 or 5 at the same time, the less the better
- **DONE** ✔: In Trello, you can just <kbd>["archive" cards](https://help.trello.com/article/795-archiving-and-deleting-cards#:~:text=Archive%20cards%20by%20clicking%20%22Archive,longer%20need%20on%20your%20board.)</kbd>, so this column is not really required in my opinion
- **Bonus** ✨: I have an extra column for things I want to remember constantly, like how do I write my address in Japanese.

### Some last tips

- Take home the things you like from GTD, but avoid being dogmatic 👩🏽‍🏫. Every person has a unique system that works better for them.

- If you can complete a To-Do task in less time than it takes to write it down and explain all its details; it makes more sense to <kbd>[just do it](https://media.giphy.com/media/GcSqyYa2aF8dy/giphy.gif)</kbd> at the current moment 💁🏼‍♀️. This might seem obvious, but you can easily fall on "the other side of productivity" when you're deep into GTD 🥴. That means letting extreme organization and bureaucracy hinder your productivity 📉. Sort of what happens with <kbd>[governments](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2158244012441603)</kbd> and <kbd>[huge organizations](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16960479)</kbd>.

- Also, it's recommended to check your whole <kbd>[Backlog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_software_development#Product_backlog)</kbd> at least once a year and make sure that it's still aligned with your long-term goals (you can write that letter to yourself again if it helps 😉!).

- Personally, it helps to organize my ideas in the form of a blog 📃: it motivates me to complete tasks that I was postponing, so I recommend it! It's a psychological mechanism 🧠 related to <kbd>["Public Accountability"](https://soapboxhq.com/blog/management-skills/create-culture-accountability-workplace)</kbd>.
